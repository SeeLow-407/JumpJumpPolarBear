        <h1 class="title">Welcome to Jump, Jump, Polarbear!</h1>

        <p>
            Welcome to our game! <br>
            <br> Our game address the environmental issue of climate 
            change which is melting ice caps and the displaced polar bears throughout 
            the north pole. This is a severe problem to address as it endangers the wildlife of
            the north pole, losing natural habitats and may even cause an entire ecosystem to be
            destroyed resulting in extinction of a population of animals.

            The game objective is to get a family of polar bears that were split 
            apart by cracking ice caps. They must run, jump from ice cap to ice cap
            to reunite with each other. Prevent them from being displaced and reunite
            them to fix a seperated family caused by disastourous circumstances. Can you do it? 
            Good Luck.
